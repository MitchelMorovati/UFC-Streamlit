# UFC-Streamlit
[App](https://ufc-visual.streamlit.app)

**Introduction**
This app aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive visual representation of the winners of UFC matches in 2023, both in terms of their physical attributes, fighting styles, and some information on Title Fights. By presenting this data visually, the project seeks to offer valuable insights to both betting enthusiasts and casual fans, aiding in understanding what constitutes a strong contender for victory in UFC matches.

**Problem Statement**
The primary objective of this project is to characterize the winners of UFC matches in 2023 through visual analysis. This involves examining the physical characteristics and stylistic traits of these winners to identify patterns and trends that may indicate factors contributing to their success in the octagon.

**Data Preparation**
The data preparation process began by sourcing the original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/remypereira/mma-dataset-2023-ufc/data). This step involved consolidating information from multiple files and extracting relevant data points necessary for analysis. It also included the creation of calculated fields to derive metrics crucial for gaining insights into the UFC winners of 2023. For example, a significant step was the generation of a binary representation of match outcomes, since the winner's identity was initially represented by individual IDs, complicating visualization efforts.

**Future Work**
While the current iteration of the application remains functional, there are opportunities for future enhancements. With the availability of data for subsequent years, such as 2024, there is potential to revisit the analysis and visualization to assess if similar insights persist or if there have been significant shifts in the UFC "meta." Continual refinement and adaptation of the project will ensure its relevance and utility in providing valuable insights to UFC enthusiasts.
